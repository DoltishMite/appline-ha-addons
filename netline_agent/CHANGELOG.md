# Changelog

## 2.5.3

- Speed tests: download speeds are no longer sometimes far too high (data the system had already received was counted as instant).
- Trace route and the ISP check fall back to the system's ping when a hop doesn't answer.

## 2.5.0

- ↻ Restart from Netline's Nodes: the agent starts again within a minute, without restarting the add-on.
- Settings fall back to their last good copy if they can't be read.

## 2.4.1

- First release: Netline Agent 2.4.1 as a Home Assistant add-on.
- Devices keep an hour-by-hour record of the last week, for Netline's uptime bars.
